<p>The JSON file format allows data to be stored in a structured, hierarchical manner, making it easy to organize and access information. It is commonly used for data interchange between web applications and servers and is also used for configuration files and data storage in various programming environments.</p>

<p>JSON files typically have the extension <code>.json</code> and are stored in a plain text format, making them easy to read and edit using any text editor. They are widely supported across different programming languages, making them a versatile choice for data representation. Many programming languages contain built-in libraries or modules for parsing and generating JSON data, or have popular third-party libraries available for this purpose.</p>

<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, reflecting its origins in the JavaScript programming language, although it is now used independently of JavaScript in many contexts.</p>
